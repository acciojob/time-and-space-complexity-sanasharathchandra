<h1>Bits & Bytes, Space & Time: Taming Complexity in the Digital Age</h1>
	<p>Faster algorithms have lower time complexity. Imagine sorting your groceries; taking one item at a time to separate them (linear time)
 is slower than using a pre-organized pantry system (constant time).
Efficient algorithms are quick and reliable. You want your tasks done well,
 without taking forever.</p>
<p><b>Space complexity </b>tells you how much memory an algorithm needs to run,
 measured in the amount of additional storage it uses during execution.
 Think of it like the space on your kitchen counter when making a sandwich.
 The more ingredients you have, the more counter space you need.</p>
